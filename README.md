# Melanoma-Detection-Assignment
CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis

## General Information
- Trained a model for detecting Melanoma Cancer using image data provided by ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration). 
- All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of 
  melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant
- The model helps in detecting following skin cancer
- The data set contains the following diseases:
    1. Actinic keratosis
    2. Basal cell carcinoma
    3. Dermatofibroma
    4. Melanoma
    5. Nevus
    6. Pigmented benign keratosis
    7. Seborrheic keratosis
    8. Squamous cell carcinoma
    9. Vascular lesion
- The model detects the above diseases with 88% accuracy. 
- Have used convolutional Neural network for training the model


## Conclusions
- The model is predicting with 88% accuracy.
